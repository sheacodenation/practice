# 02.6 Guided/Independent Practice


Now that we've learned about parameters and arguments, let's refactor these functions to use them! 
### Guided Practice

1. Refactor (change) the `multiplyByTwo` function to take one parameter (you can call it whatever you want, but `num` or `number` make sense).

2. In "Task Two", call the `multiplyByTwo` function in the `.text()` method with any one argument so that the result is displayed on the screen.

### Independent Practice 

3. Rewrite the function `greetByName` in "Task 3" to take a parameter. 

4. In "Task Four", call the `greetByName` function with any one argument inside the `.text` method so that a greeting followed by a person's name is displayed on the screen.

5. In "Task Five", rewrite the `canYouVote` function to take a parameter. **Note:** You are going to have to get rid of some of the code already in the function body, so that you can pass any argument you want and get a result.
